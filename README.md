# AcademicData

First things first I added numpy and panda data librarys.

I then proceeded to make sure that they were both working by creating a simple data set and using that to test it out.

After that I imported my csv file which is a study about colleges done by the Us department of education, linked below.

The codebook is linked here:

I printed the list options to make it easier to choose.

After I found something I found interesting in the codebook in this instance the average salary after 3 years per college I made a collum list to make the data easier to understand.

I also made a histogram chart to be able to visualize the data.

Finally after doing that I found the mean, median and standard deviation. I also found the college with the most earnings after 3 years was the Ohio state university dental school.
